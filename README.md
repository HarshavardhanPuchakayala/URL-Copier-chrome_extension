# chrome_extension
I've developed a Chrome extension that simplifies web data extraction and management. This extension utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to offer three key functions:

1. **Input Data**: Users can input data, which is displayed within the extension for easy reference.

2. **Copy URL**: The second button allows users to conveniently copy the URL of the current tab, facilitating quick sharing or reference.

3. **Data Deletion**: The third button clears all stored data within the extension, maintaining user privacy.

This project showcases the practical use of web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for building a user-friendly extension that enhances web browsing. Its simplicity and efficiency make it a valuable tool for users seeking to streamline their online data management. You can find the project on my GitHub for more details and contributions.![Screenshot (44)](https://github.com/HarshavardhanPuchakayala/chrome_extension/assets/85436195/5b231c48-6a8d-44f7-8742-29d6e1fadae8)
